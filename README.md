This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

# Building Release Versions

## Creating APK and AAB files for Android

When you're ready to release your Android app, you'll need to generate a signed APK or AAB file.

### Generating a Keystore

First, you need to generate a signing key using keytool:

```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

### Setting up Gradle Variables

Place the `my-release-key.keystore` file in the `android/app` directory.

Edit your `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` or `android/gradle.properties` file and add:

```
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE=my-release-key.keystore
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS=my-key-alias
MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD=*****
MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD=*****
```

### Configuring Gradle for Release

Edit the file `android/app/build.gradle` and add the signing config:

```gradle
signingConfigs {
    release {
        storeFile file(MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
        storePassword MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
        keyAlias MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
        keyPassword MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
    }
}
buildTypes {
    release {
        signingConfig signingConfigs.release
        // ...existing config
    }
}
```

### Building the APK

Run the following command to generate a release APK:

```bash
# using npm
npm run android -- --mode=release

# OR using Yarn
yarn android --mode=release
```

The APK file will be located at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### Building the AAB (Android App Bundle)

To generate an AAB file for Google Play Store:

```bash
# navigate to android directory
cd android

# using Gradle
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

The AAB file will be located at `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

For more details, refer to the [React Native official documentation on publishing to Google Play Store](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android).
